# SQL Conclusion

We've learned all about the basics of SQL. With SQL, we can store and find our
stored data. SQL has many variations, but in this module, we specifically
covered using SQLite which will be the type of database that we work with
throughout this course.

Over the past several lessons we covered:

- How to create and open a database file and table
- The different SQLite database types
- How to perform CRUD actions in SQL
- How to create advanced queries

This gives us the foundational tools of understanding how to build and
manipulate databases. This will tie into future concepts, as we cover databases
and Ruby more in-depth.
